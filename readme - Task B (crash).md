# Crash Data Analysis
## Tasks
- [ ] Download the initial project files from the LMS
- [ ] Write your first commit adding these files in your repository
- [ ] Inspect the code in `main.py`
- Fill in missing sections of `readme.md`
  - [ ] Fill in *Initial Program Behaviour* section
  - [ ] Fill in the *Future Development* sections
- [ ] Commit the changes to `readme.md` and push the changes to your eng-git repository

## Initial Program Behavior
Fill in this section outlining what the program does.
Focus on:
- What the form of the initial data is
- The meaning of user inputs and program outputs from the program user's perspective

## Dependencies
Fill in this section, list any libraries that this program requires to run.
- Data (Waka Kotahi) CC BY 4.0
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## How to Run
To execute this program run following command from a terminal:

`python3 main.py`

## Future Development
Fill in this section, outline features that you would like to expand beyond the minimum features outlined in the second part of the assignment.

### Basic Analysis Feature
You will need to outline at least on analysis that you plan to implement. Please include details on sources of new data required to complete this analysis.

This analysis must feature at least one [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) graph.

Examples of basic analysis:

- correlating the speed limit and the severity of crashes
- graphing the number of traffic incidences over time
- ...

### Student Lead Features
You are to provide a set of features research and developed by you. They need to integrate the use of libraries **not** presented in the course.

For example you could:

- develop a traffic dashboard using libraries like [streamlit](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit/), [panel](https://pypi.org/project/panel/) or [dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)
- generate Choropleths using [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/choropleth-maps/) that display geographic information on a map
- Application Programming Interface (API) using [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) to integrate live data into your program.

## Citations

As you develop your project you will use a variety of resources. Cite and reference each as using the APA 7th format.
